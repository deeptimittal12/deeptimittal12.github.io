## Conda installation and setup

### Install Miniconda3 for 64-bit Linux

Please note that Miniconda3 is Python-**3** based.
We tested our pipeline on a 64-bit Linux system.
Moreover, after installing Miniconda, please *close* the console for the changes to be active.
You might have to open a new terminal.

### Add channels to the conda environment

# Please remember that the CHANNEL ORDER IS IMPORTANT
conda config --add channels defaults

```
